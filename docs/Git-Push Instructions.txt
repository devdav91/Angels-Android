To push your changes up to Github:

Commands: (step by step)

Before working: git pull main master
	- take all of the edits I have done

git add [file path]
	- adds a file to be tracked by Github
	- typically after adding a new file
	- also for not txt files (i.e. doc, jpeg)
	- i.e. git add docs/contracts/development-service-contract.doc

git add -p
	- do this after changing code
	- shows you list by list what changes you've done 
	- can select to accept changes or delete them
		- there are alot of other options but i don't know what they do

git commit -m "[Message]"
	- this is for when you are done working and want to save your changes
	- write a very short description of what you've worked on in the [Message]
	
git push origin master
	- pushes your changes to your repository


Making a Pull Request
	- This is for adding your changes to my(the main) repository. It's a request for me to pull from your repository, so everything should be working perfectly, 	and everything should be the same except for the things you've edited

	1. on Github, go to your "Angels" repository, not mine
	2. On the left panel, click "Pull requests"
	3. Create new pull request
	4. Submit
